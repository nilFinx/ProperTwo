# What is it?

ProperTwo is an improvement of ProperTree, which `is a cross-platform GUI plist editor written using Python *(compatible with both 2.x and 3.x)* and Tkinter.`
README.md is really empty, to avoid having to solve merge conflicts. Before you ask any questions. 

## New features
- [x] Don't expand everything when performing an OC snapshot, keep everything closed
